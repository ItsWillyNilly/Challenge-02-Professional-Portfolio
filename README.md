# Challenge-02 Professional Portfolio
This is my professional portfolio created using HTML and CSS.

## Description
I was tasked with creating a professional portfolio for showcasing all the work I will be doing over the course of the bootcamp. I used HTML and CSS to create the foundation and style for my portfolio. Each project will have a title, an image and a link tied to it, so when the user clicks on the image they are taken to the the live site to see how each project functions.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
